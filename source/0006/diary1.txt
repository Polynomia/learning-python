For regression tasks, the goal is to predict a continuous number, or a floating-point number in programming terms (or real number in mathematical terms). Predicting a personâ€™s annual income from their education, their age, and where they live is an example of a regression task. When predicting income, the predicted value is an amount, and can be any number in a given range. Another example of a regression task is predicting the yield of a corn farm given attributes such as previous yields, weather, and number of employees working on the farm. The yield again can be an arbitrary number.
